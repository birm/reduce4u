Persona 1: Data Researcher
This person will be reasonably educated, and familiar with the theory of the data involved, as well as familiar with at least one other data visualization tool. This person wants to work with their team on the problem without thinking about the teamwork directly, and wants to focus on the issue at hand. This person will be on a phone or computer, and is comfortable with both.

Persona 2: Team Leader
This person is a special version of the data researcher, except that the nature of their team or teams is the core focus for them. They need to be able to add and remove members and modify their permissions. They'll be interested in, as well, ways to present the reports without a computer present.

Persona 3: Viewer
This person is not involved in the project, but hopes to be able to understand the data using the visualizations. A quick understanding is most important here. This person may not have a computer, may be on a phone, or may be in a presentation viewing non-interactively.
